# Project Cleanup TODO

## Unused Images (Manual Deletion Required)
The following files in the `public/` directory are not referenced anywhere in the codebase and can be safely deleted to reduce project bloat:
- public/placeholder-logo.png
- public/placeholder-user.jpg
- public/placeholder.jpg
- public/shsh-square-logo-blackbg-footer.avif
- public/shsh-square-logo-transparentbg-whitelines.jpg
- public/shsh-square-logo.avif

> These could not be deleted automatically due to binary file handling. Please delete them manually.

## General Next.js Best Practices
- [ ] Consider enabling image optimization for all images using the Next.js `<Image />` component.
- [ ] Review and update the README with any new scripts, environment variables, or setup steps.
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are documented and not hardcoded.
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to catch any remaining issues or warnings.
- [ ] If you add new static assets, place them in the `public/` directory and reference them with `/` paths.
- [ ] If you add new pages, use the `/app` directory structure for routing.
