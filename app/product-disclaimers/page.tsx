        Strong Hands, Soft Heart LLC ("we," "our," or "us") creates handcrafted artisanal skincare
        products, including soaps, balms, and related natural goods. By purchasing, using, or
        gifting any of our products, you agree to the terms outlined below.
      </p>

      <h2>1. No Medical Claims</h2>
      <p>
        Our products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical
        condition. Any descriptions of ingredients, herbal traditions, or benefits are for
        educational and informational purposes only, based on historical or traditional usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statements made on this website have not been evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a medical condition or concern, consult a licensed healthcare professional
        before use.
      </p>

      <h2>2. For External Use Only</h2>
      <p>
        Unless explicitly labeled otherwise, all products are intended for topical use only. Do not
        ingest. Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, or broken skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of accidental ingestion or adverse reaction, discontinue use immediately and
        seek medical help.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Allergies and Skin Sensitivities</h2>
      <p>
        All ingredients are clearly listed on product labels and/or the website. Our products may
        contain natural substances such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Essential oils</li>
        <li>Botanicals and herbs</li>
        <li>Nut-derived oils (e.g., coconut, almond)</li>
        <li>Clays and mineral powders</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have allergies, sensitivities, or are pregnant/nursing, consult your physician or
        midwife before use. We recommend conducting a patch test 24 hours prior to full use.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for reading and understanding all product information before
        applying to your skin or body.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Natural Variation</h2>
      <p>
        Each item is handcrafted in small batches using natural ingredients. As such, color, scent,
        shape, and texture may vary slightly from one batch to another. This does not affect product
        integrity or performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minor imperfections are a reflection of artisanal quality, not factory-grade uniformity.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Storage & Shelf Life</h2>
      <p>To ensure optimal quality and performance, please:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store products in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and humidity</li>
        <li>Use clean hands or utensils when handling</li>
        <li>Follow any use-by or batch codes if printed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shelf life varies by product but is generally 6 to 12 months from the date of purchase.</p>

      <h2>6. No Guarantees of Results</h2>
      <p>
        Natural products affect each body differently. While we take pride in formulation, we do not
        guarantee specific outcomes from use (e.g., clearer skin, reduced dryness, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>Individual experiences may vary.</p>

      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        By using our products, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Strong Hands, Soft Heart
        LLC, its owner(s), and any collaborators from any and all liability, loss, or damage
        (including but not limited to allergic reactions, skin irritation, or product misuse).
      </p>
      <p>Use of our products is voluntary and at your own risk.</p>

      <h2>8. Returns & Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the personal nature of skincare, we cannot accept returns on opened or used items. If
        your item arrived damaged or defective, please contact us at hello@stronghandssoftheart.com
        within 7 days of delivery. We may offer a replacement or refund at our discretion.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Legal Age of Purchase</h2>
      <p>
        You must be 18 years or older to purchase from our store, or have the supervision and
        permission of a legal guardian.
      </p>
