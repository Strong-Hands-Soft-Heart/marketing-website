        The following applies to all handcrafted skincare products, including but not limited to
        artisan soaps, balms, oils, or other topical products made and sold by Strong Hands, Soft
        Heart LLC.
      </p>

      <h2>1. No Medical Claims</h2>
      <p>
        Our products are for external use only. They are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or
        prevent any disease or condition. Any statements about ingredient properties reflect
        traditional or historical usage, not medical advice.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Allergies and Sensitivities</h2>
      <p>
        Our skincare products may contain natural ingredients such as essential oils, botanicals, or
        nut-based oils. If you have sensitive skin or allergies, perform a patch test before full
        use. Discontinue use if irritation occurs.
      </p>
      <p>You are responsible for reviewing ingredients before use.</p>

      <h2>3. Natural Variations</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the handcrafted nature of our products, slight variations in scent, texture, or color
        may occur from batch to batch. This reflects the use of real, natural materials — not
        defects.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Storage and Handling</h2>
      <p>
        Store in a cool, dry place away from heat and direct sunlight. Natural products can degrade
        over time; use within 6–12 months for best results.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Liability</h2>
      <p>
        By purchasing or using our skincare products, you accept full responsibility for your usage.
        Strong Hands, Soft Heart LLC is not liable for adverse reactions, allergic responses, or
        misuse of our products.
